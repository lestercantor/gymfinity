# Gymfinity
A front-end website project for a fictional gym. The aim of the website is to attract potential and retain members, whilst providing information about the gym, its facilities and organised classes.

# User Stories
As the site owner, my goals are:
* To promote a healthier lifestyle
* To motivate members to join

User goals for the website are:
* As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find information about the gym (location and opening hours) so that I can make a decision to join
* As a first-time visitor, I want to see pictures of the equipment the gym provides
* As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find the sign up page 
* As a first-time or recurring visitor, I want to easily find information on the classes and their schedule
* As a recurring visitor, I want everything that I saw the first time I visited

# UXD (User Experience Design)
### Strategy
The purpose of the website is to attract new members to sign up for the gym and to retain current members. My target audience are for people aged 16+ and for all levels of fitness. The website will be able to offer the user's goals by ensuring that navigating through the website is simple and the information they need will be clear and concise. Since most, if not all, users of the intended audience have access to mobile phones, it is important that the website is responsive.
### Scope
For a comfortable user experience, features will include:
* Navigation bar to navigate through different pages. A collapsed menu bar to be in place for smaller screens
* Home page providing information about the gym and why to sign up
* Section in the home page detailing the schedule of classes so it's easily visible
* A page dedicated to showing the gym equipment and facilities
* Sign up form 
### Structure
The website will have 3 pages: Home -> Equipment & Facilities -> Sign up. Users can scroll through the home page to find most of the information as it will be the main body of information. Blocks of text will be kept short with images and icons to keep the user's attention and to not overwhelm them. There will be a simple sign up form for users to sign up.

[Wireframe Mockup](../gymfinity/docs/wireframe%20mockup.png)
### Surface
I will have a dark navigation bar, contrasted with a light background for the main body of the page so the navigation bar clearly anchors the top of the page for users to see. The light background for the main page is so that the information is clearly striking to attract the attention of the user. 

A simple font like "Roboto" from Google fonts will used as it is clear and easily readable. My aim is to have the images to attract the user's attention whilst having text accompanying it to convey the information.
